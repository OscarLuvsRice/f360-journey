   - When extruding on an existing extruded shape, if choose negative, the shape will be extruded inside.
   - Choosing taper angle allows the extuded shape to be in an angle.

**Multi face shell**

   - Choosing multiple face to shell can be used to create more complex geometries, in this case an ice cube tray.

**Equal and coincidence sketch**


   - Can be used to assist the making of guide rails.
   - allow easier sketch mirroring
 <br>
 <br>
 
**Construction of midplane**

   - allows a sketch plane to be created in the middle of two existing geometries.
