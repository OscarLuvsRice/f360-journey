   - Prints or carves text onto existing geometry.

**Project**

   - From my interpretation, Project allows the user to use 3d geometry as a reference point to use in 2d sketching.
   - For example: if you look at a cylinder from the side, you can use project to reference the circle and use it for offset pruposes or smt.
